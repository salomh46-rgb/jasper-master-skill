# Voice-Default Template (Inactive Channel)

This template is emitted by Skill 1 in greenfield Phase 2 when the bot has chat channel active but voice channel inactive. It is also emitted in patch mode when channel scope expands from chat-only to voice+chat.

The emitted text carries **no provenance marker in the body**. Skill 1 records the default in
spec **§7.7 Prompt provenance** instead (v1.20.2 — see the note below).

The body follows the Markdown shape in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/prompt-structure.md` — `voiceInstructions` carries sections 1–4 and no Global directives block.

Skill 1 substitutes `[[PLACEHOLDERS]]` at write time. Bracketed `[[...]]` is build-time substitution syntax — distinct from runtime Mustache `{{...}}` to avoid collision.

> **Section 2.2's body is runtime prompt content.** Skill 3 copies it verbatim into
> `prompts.voiceInstructions`, so every character written there is read by the model at call
> time. Never put a provenance marker, a maintenance note, or a build-time instruction in it —
> that is what §7.7 exists for. Until v1.20.2 this template opened with
> `[default — not user-authored]` and closed with a "regenerate this section through Skill 1
> patch mode" sentence; both shipped into the deployed prompt. Caught by V-C2, 2026-08-16.

## Template

```
# 1. Pace and delivery

* **Identity:** you are speaking as [[PERSONA_IDENTITY]]. Maintain the same identity and tone as defined in the global persona.
* **Pace:** speak clearly and at a measured pace. Never rush.
* **Pauses:** avoid long silences. If you need a moment to look something up, say so explicitly before you go quiet.

#### 2. Reading numbers

* **Names and addresses:** pronounce them carefully, and confirm them back to the caller once collected.
* **Digit strings:** read phone numbers, ID numbers and reference codes digit by digit, never as one quantity.

#### 3. Interruptions

* **Yield immediately:** if the caller interrupts, stop speaking at once and listen.
* **You must never** talk over the caller to finish your own sentence.

#### 4. Prohibited

* **Language:** use [[PRIMARY_LANGUAGE]] only. Never switch languages mid-call unless the caller does.
* **You must never** vocalise written formatting, symbols or URLs.
```

## Substitution rules

### `[[PERSONA_IDENTITY]]`

Extract from spec section 2.1 (`prompts.persona`). Take the first sentence or two that establishes who the bot is — name, role, company. Examples:
- Persona starts "את יובל, נציגת שירות הלקוחות של חברת NC..." → `[[PERSONA_IDENTITY]]` = "יובל, נציגת שירות הלקוחות של חברת NC"
- Persona starts "You are Sarah, a scheduling assistant at Acme Corp." → `[[PERSONA_IDENTITY]]` = "Sarah, a scheduling assistant at Acme Corp."

If `[[PERSONA_IDENTITY]]` cannot be cleanly extracted (e.g., persona is multi-paragraph and identity is buried), fall back to: `the bot persona defined in section 2.1`.

### `[[PRIMARY_LANGUAGE]]`

Map from the language code in spec section 1 to a human-readable name:

| Code | Substitution |
|---|---|
| `he-IL` | Hebrew |
| `en-US` | English |
| `en-GB` | English |
| `es-ES` | Spanish |
| `fr-FR` | French |
| `de-DE` | German |
| `ar-SA` | Arabic |

If the code is unrecognized, substitute the raw code itself.
