### 4.1 Step 1 — Slot detailing

Section 4 declares slot names, ParameterTypeIds, required flags, and collection orders. Step 1 elaborates each slot.

**Per slot, capture:**

| Field | Meaning | When |
|---|---|---|
| `Description` | User-facing description used by the LLM at runtime to phrase the slot collection question. Often Hebrew. | All slots |
| `OptionList` (with `Value` + `Label` per option) | Static list of choices | ENUM (PT=19) with known choices |
| `OptionList: []` + note | Options come from upstream API response | ENUM (PT=19) dynamically populated (typically downstream of an RT=2 intent declared in 4.5.4) |
| Validation guidance for v1 fallback | Format/range constraints to embed in `validationPrompt` | NUMBER/DATE/EMAIL stored as STRING (PT=1) per Skill 1 v1 fallback |

**Example slot detailing (Hebrew bot, RT=3 confirm_appointment intent):**

```
Slot: address
- Description: כתובת מלאה: רחוב, מספר בית, עיר. למשל: רחוב הרצל 14 רמת גן.
- Type: STRING (ParameterTypeId 1)
- Required: true
- Collection order: 1
- OptionList: [empty for STRING]

Slot: time_slot
- Description: בחירת זמן מבין הזמנים הזמינים שהוצגו לך
- Type: ENUM (ParameterTypeId 19)
- Required: true
- Collection order: 2
- OptionList: [] (dynamically populated from upstream get_available_slots response — see section 4.5.4)
```

**Iron rule (check 4 — fires during step 1, blocking):** if section 4 declared a slot with a type that mismatches its purpose (e.g., STRING for "phone"), do NOT silently fix. Raise:

> Slot `<name>` is declared as `<type>` in section 4 but the description suggests it should be `<other type>` (e.g., PHONE, ParameterTypeId 10). This is a structural change. Pause Skill 2, invoke Skill 1 patch mode to fix the slot type, then return.

The user must either accept the type as-is (with appropriate v1-fallback validation in step 2) or pause and patch via Skill 1.

**Iron rule (sensitive backstop — v1.14.0; fires during step 1, advisory):** if this intent's slots collect truly sensitive data (national ID / ID number, credit card number / CVV / expiry / cardholder ID, medical information) and section 4 does NOT carry `**Sensitive:** true` on it, raise to the user:

> Intent `<name>` collects `<what>` but is not flagged `**Sensitive:** true`. The flag belongs on the COLLECTING intent (this one). Recommend: pause and set it via Skill 1 patch mode — Skill 2 never edits section-4 flags.

Whenever an intent IS (or becomes) sensitive-flagged, ALWAYS deliver the disclosure — even if the user didn't ask: *"This intent has sensitive-data handling enabled for Information Security — the collected details can still be used in API calls configured on this same intent, but they will NOT be saved in the LOGS/TRACES."* Log to 7.3.

### 4.2 Step 2 — `validationPrompt` authoring

**Doctrine (v1.13.0, FP-5 — this section was inverted; see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/field-placement-doctrine.md`):** the `validationPrompt` is consumed ONLY by the **Intent Agent** — the parameter-extraction/validation layer. It is never spoken and never forwarded to the live voice model. Anything written here that was meant to be spoken **will not be spoken** (verified production behavior). Its content is therefore a **capture mapping**: 1–3 short bullet lines, one per outcome or slot, in save/capture/set language. English operational prose is recommended (Compass rule 3 synergy); target-language text appears only as a quoted VALUE being saved.

Canonical form (golden reference, verbatim style):

```
* If the customer confirms, save "true" in the parameter details_confirmed.
* If the customer disapproves, save "false" in the parameter details_confirmed.
```

For an intent carrying a section-4 `**Terminal outcome:**`, write the form matching the declared **value mode**:

- **fixed** (quoted value in the spec): pin the exact string —
  `1. Set <slot> to exactly this value; do not translate, paraphrase, or alter it: "<the fixed string>"`
  `2. Never ask the customer to choose or confirm this value — it is fixed for this outcome.`
- **captured**: save the customer's utterance — `Save the callback time (day and hour) the customer stated in the parameter callback_time.`
- **dynamic**: an explicit per-call composition instruction for the slot.

**FORBIDDEN in validationPrompt (blocking — check 3, mirrored by CHK-16):** scripts to speak, questions to ask, greetings, turn-taking guards, routing instructions, ALL-CAPS "GATE" recipes with `Say…`/`Ask…` steps. The asking happens where the voice model can see it — in the **previous** intent's `announcement` (FP-2 staggering) or this intent's post-execution `intentInstructions` (step 4). See `conversation-routines-style-guide.md` §3 for the capture-mapping patterns (C1–C5); the field opens with `# 1. Capture mapping` per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/prompt-structure.md`.

**Authoring procedure:**

1. **Read the intent's slots (step 1) and its section-4 `**Captures answer to:**`** — the question whose answer this intent stores was asked one step earlier (or by the opening). The mapping translates *that answer* into *this intent's slots*.

2. **Draft the mapping bullets** — one line per collectable slot / per outcome of the captured question; for `**Terminal outcome:**` intents, the value-mode form above.

3. **Ask the user about capture edge cases** where relevant:
   > When the caller answers "[the captured question]", how should edge answers map? E.g., a hesitant "אולי"/"maybe" — save as false, or leave the slot unfilled and let the instructions re-ask? A partial answer for `[slot]` — save what was given?

4. **Show the draft to the user.** They confirm or edit.

5. **Verify** before moving on:
   - Every collectable slot in the intent has exactly one mapping line
   - Every v1-fallback slot's mapping line carries its format/range constraint (e.g., "save only if a valid 9-digit ID, else leave unfilled")
   - NO speech content: no ask/say/tell/greet/read-back imperatives, no question addressed to the caller, no turn-taking or "wait" guards, no routing
   - For a `**Terminal outcome:**` intent: the mapping implements the declared value mode (fixed ⇒ the exact string appears verbatim)
   - Every Mustache reference resolves (see section 5 — Mustache resolvability mechanics)

If any of these fail at end-of-step, return to authoring; do not advance to step 3.

**Iron rule (sequential collection — retargeted v1.13.0; fires during steps 2–4, blocking):**

If the intent has **two or more collectable slots**, the questions must still be asked one at a time — but the ASK sequence no longer lives in `validationPrompt` (the voice model never sees it). "Collectable" excludes values populated from an upstream RT=2 API response — those are not asked of the caller.

Two conditions, both required:

1. The questions are authored where the voice model sees them — in the previous intent's `announcement`/instructions or this intent's `intentInstructions` (step 4) — **one question per turn**, ordered by `CollectionOrder`, each mandated line using the FP-4 quote convention.
2. `validationPrompt` carries exactly one capture line per slot (no bundled "capture everything" line).

If either condition is unmet, **block** — do not flip the intent to `[detailed]`.

A single logical slot the caller answers in one breath (e.g. a `full address` STRING covering street + number + city) is still **one** slot and therefore one turn — the rule constrains across distinct declared slots, not the internal richness of one slot.

Log on resolution to section 7.3: `Sequential-collection rule fired on [intent] — resolved`.

**Iron rule (Compass rule 8 — TTS-safe formatting; retargeted v1.13.0; fires during steps 3–4, blocking on markdown/URLs and advisory on long digit runs):**

`validationPrompt` is EXEMPT from rule 8 — it is never vocalized (FP-5), and its canonical capture-mapping form legitimately uses `*` bullets. The three detections below run instead on every **spoken** field Skill 2 authors on a voice-active intent (`announcement`, `intentLoadingAnnouncement`, `fail_output`, `function_output`, and the FP-4 quoted lines inside post-execution `intentInstructions`):

1. **Markdown formatting** — regex `(?m)^\s*[-*+]\s` (bullets), `(?m)^\s*#+\s` (headers), or `\[.*\]\(.*\)` (markdown links). If matched: **blocking** — voice will read these aloud literally ("dash space hello"). Surface:
   > Line `[N]` of `[spoken field]` in `[intent]` contains markdown formatting (`[matched pattern]`). Per Compass §5 anti-pattern "Chat-agent boilerplate copied to voice", TTS reads markdown literally. Rewrite as natural-language prose before proceeding.

2. **URLs** — regex `https?://\S+`. If matched: **blocking** — TTS would read the URL aloud. Surface:
   > Line `[N]` of `[spoken field]` in `[intent]` contains a URL (`[matched URL]`). Voice agents should not vocalize URLs. Replace with a description ("our website") or move the URL out of the prompt entirely.

3. **Long digit runs without spell-out instruction** — regex `\d{6,}` AND no `(?i)(digit by digit|spell|ספרה ספרה|חזרי ספרה)` instruction within 100 surrounding characters. If matched: **advisory** — surface:
   > A long digit sequence (`[matched]`) appears in `[spoken field]` of `[intent]` without a nearby "spell digit-by-digit" instruction. Per Compass §6 voice output rules, long digit runs read awkwardly. Consider adding an explicit spell-out instruction (e.g., "חזרי ספרה ספרה" for Hebrew; "Read digit by digit" for English). Continue without fix, or pause to add?

Log per-intent resolution to section 7.3: `Compass rule 8 advisory/blocking fired on [intent].[field] — [resolved: yes/no]`.

**Iron rule (Compass rule 9 — date math in prompt; fires during step 2, advisory):**

In each `validationPrompt`, search for date-math patterns:
- `(?i)\bnot\s+(in\s+)?(the\s+)?future\b`
- `(?i)\b(year|שנה)\s*[≥>=]+\s*\d{4}\b`
- `(?i)\b(today|tomorrow|yesterday)\b` AND no surrounding `{{TimeNow}}` or equivalent Mustache reference within 200 characters.

If matched: advisory — surface:
> `validationPrompt` of `[intent]` contains date-math instructions (`[matched pattern]`). Per Compass §2 anti-list "Date and time math" and §8 operating rule 8, LLMs are notoriously bad at calendar arithmetic, especially under latency pressure. The doctrine recommends computing dates server-side and injecting them as pre-rendered Mustache variables in section 4.5.1 (e.g., `{{TimeNow}}` for current ISO, `{{TodayHumanHe}}` for a localized human form). Two paths:
>   (a) Replace the date-math instruction with a Mustache reference to a pre-rendered variable. Skill 2 cannot add to 4.5.1 (that's Skill 1's territory) — pause and invoke Skill 1 patch mode to declare the new call-context variable, then return.
>   (b) Keep the date-math instruction and accept the runtime risk.

Log per-intent: `Compass rule 9 advisory fired on [intent].validationPrompt — [resolved: yes/no]`.

**Iron rule (Compass rule 10 — few-shot example cap; fires during step 2, advisory):**

In each `validationPrompt`, count transcript-style example pairs. A pair is matched by:
- A line matching `(?im)^\s*(user|caller|פונה|לקוח)\s*:` followed within 10 lines by
- A line matching `(?im)^\s*(agent|bot|נציג|בוט)\s*:`.

If more than 2 pairs are found in a single `validationPrompt`: advisory — surface:
> `validationPrompt` of `[intent]` contains `[N]` transcript-style few-shot examples. Per Compass §4 "Examples vs rules", each transcript example is 80–200 tokens in English and 250–500 in Hebrew — three Hebrew few-shots can blow the entire prompt budget. The doctrine recommendation is zero examples by default; add one or two only to fix specific recurring failures (brand-name pronunciation, Hebrew date register, a misclassified tool trigger). Two paths:
>   (a) Trim to the single most calibration-relevant pair.
>   (b) Keep as-is and accept the token cost (will surface in Skill 3's rule 1 token-budget check at assembly time).

If the bot's primary language is non-English, prepend to the message: *"This bot is `[language]`, so the per-example cost is roughly 3× the English baseline — trimming has higher ROI here."*

Log per-intent: `Compass rule 10 advisory fired on [intent].validationPrompt with [N] examples — [resolved: yes/no]`.

**Iron rule (Compass rule 11 — Hebrew-utterance isolation; fires during steps 2, 3, and 4; blocking):**

For each text field Skill 2 authors (`validationPrompt`, RT-specific `announcement`/`fail_output`/`function_output`/`intentLoadingAnnouncement`, post-execution `intentInstructions`), run per-line:

Detection regex: a line contains `[֐-׿؀-ۿ一-鿿぀-ゟ゠-ヿ]+` AND the line's remaining non-whitespace content is ≥50% ASCII alphanumerics. (A line that is entirely Hebrew, or entirely English, passes. A line that mixes inline fails.)

If matched: blocking — surface:
> Line `[N]` of `[field]` in `[intent]` mixes inline RTL (`[matched text]`) with LTR English text. Per Compass §4 "Sanity rule: never inject RTL Hebrew strings into the middle of an LTR English instruction line" — terminal display lies and Unicode bidi marks tokenize to garbage. Move the RTL content to its own line, wrap it in quotes, or rewrite the line entirely. Then re-check.

Block authoring of this field until the user provides a compliant revision.

Log per-intent on resolution: `Compass rule 11 blocking fired on [intent].[field] line [N] — resolved`.

**TTS sanitization (voice-agent-llm v1.0.3+):** the service now sanitizes voice-active text before it reaches TTS, so unintended Markdown is no longer spoken literally. The existing authoring rule still applies: write plain conversational prose in the spoken fields — `announcement`, `intentLoadingAnnouncement`, `fail_output`, `function_output`, and the quoted spoken lines of post-execution `intentInstructions`. (`validationPrompt` is exempt — never vocalized, v1.13.0 FP-5.) The sanitizer is a belt-and-suspenders safeguard, not a substitute for clean authoring.

### 4.4 Step 4 — Post-execution `intentInstructions`

This is the second Markdown-structured block per intent. It defines what the bot does **after** this intent has fired and slots have been collected. It opens with `# 1. Post-execution` per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/prompt-structure.md`.

**Critical distinction (per Doc 1 §14.3.10, §14.3.12):**

- `validationPrompt` is the Intent-Agent capture mapping (v1.13.0, FP-5) — never spoken
- `intentInstructions` (per-intent) is **post-execution** — delivered to the voice model after the tool completes: what to do next

Skill 2 writes `intentInstructions` (v1.13.0) to cover:

- **Post-answer routing by Description text** (FP-9): `* If the customer approves, forward the call to confirming health declaration.` / `* If the customer disapproves, forward the call to Ending the call by forwarding the call to a hangup layer.`
- **The explicit wait rule — ONLY on intents that ask a question (v1.17.0 scope fix)**: `After asking, stop and wait for the customer's explicit answer. Do not save a value or proceed to the next intent until the customer responds.` This line belongs ONLY where this intent's `announcement` or instructions actually ask the caller something (`**Asks next:**` is a question). **NEVER author it on an auto-chaining intent (`**Asks next:**` [none])** — post-execution the answer is already captured, so the voice model obeys the wait, stalls for a caller turn that never comes, and the silence loop fires (verified live). Auto-chaining intents get the OPPOSITE instruction instead: `Immediately forward the call to <next intent's Description>, without waiting for a response from the customer.`
- **Optional mandated spoken lines via the FP-4 quote convention** — the sanctioned home for speech when the announcement is empty (FP-3 exception) or the step involves several short questions: `Say to the customer : "מצויין, אז קבענו ל {{callback_time}}, נחזור אלייך, שיהיה המשך יום טוב"` — then route.
- Conditional next-intent routing if the intent's outcome varies (RT=2 with conditional success/failure paths)
- Iron rules for what NOT to do post-execution (scope-creep prevention)

**Authoring procedure:**

1. Surface any staged notes for this intent from section 2.4 (the section 7.3 scan).
2. Draft an initial `intentInstructions` block in the Markdown structure (`# 1. Post-execution`), naming each routing target as `**<tool_name>** — "<Description>"`, including the wait rule; add FP-4 quoted lines only where the announcement doesn't already carry the speech (FP-6 say-once).
3. Show the draft. User confirms or edits.
4. Verify against the iron rules below.

**Iron rules (checks 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 15 — fire during step 4, blocking):**

| Rule | Source | Catch pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Must follow the prompt structure | `prompt-structure.md` | Free prose without the `# 1. Post-execution` heading, bold-condition numbered steps, or `CRITICAL:` lines → reformat |
| Must NOT contain pre-execution slot collection logic | §14.3.12 | Sentences like "after collecting X, ensure it's…" or validation rules → relocate to `validationPrompt` |
| Must NOT contain persistent policy that applies call-wide | §14.3.13 | Sentences about privacy, GDPR, retention, broad escalation policy → relocate to `prompts.persona` (raise to user; this is a Skill 1 patch) |
| Must NOT contain bot-level disambiguation that runs before any intent fires | §14.3.11 | Sentences like "first figure out if the user wants X or Y…" → relocate to `prompts.intentInstructions` (bot-level; raise to user; this is a Skill 1 patch) |
| Own-parameters only (v1.13.0, FP-8 — check 13) | FP-8 | Any parameter name mentioned in this intent's `validationPrompt` / `announcement` / `intentInstructions` must exist in THIS intent's slot list. "Set status_shikuf to …" on a gate that doesn't own `status_shikuf` is un-executable at runtime — either the parameter moves to this intent (Skill 1 patch) or the reference is removed. Raise to user; never author around it. |
| Quote convention (v1.13.0, FP-4 — check 15) | FP-4 | Every mandated verbatim spoken line uses `<instruction text> : "<line>"` (colon before the quoted line). Unquoted inline speech or a quoted line with no instruction verb → reformat. |

**Misplacement handling during drafting:**

- For §14.3.12 (slot validation in intentInstructions): Skill 2 silently relocates to `validationPrompt` and informs the user. This is content Skill 2 owns on both sides of the misplacement.
- For §14.3.13 (persistent policy) and §14.3.11 (bot-level disambiguation): Skill 2 raises to user. The destination field (`prompts.persona` or `prompts.intentInstructions` bot-level) is in section 2, which Skill 2 does not modify. Recommended message:

> The text "<snippet>" appears to be <persistent policy | bot-level disambiguation> that belongs in section 2.<X>. I won't put it in this intent's post-execution instructions. Options: (a) drop the text, (b) pause Skill 2, invoke Skill 1 patch mode to add it to section 2.<X>, then return. Which?

If the user picks (b), record the choice in 7.3 and halt the current intent's authoring. The user runs Skill 1 patch mode separately, then re-invokes Skill 2 — the spec state will reflect the patch.

---

## 5. Mustache resolvability mechanics

Doc 1 §14.3.5 iron rule: every Mustache slot variable must resolve against an allowlist. Skill 2 enforces this **blocking** at field-write time and at end-of-intent gate.

### 5.1 Allowlist sources

| Reference shape | Allowlist source | Resolves if… |
|---|---|---|
| `{{slot_name}}` | Section 4.5.3 (slot inventory) | The slot is collected by THIS intent OR by an upstream intent in the flow graph (see 5.2) |
| `{{call_context_var}}` | Section 4.5.1 | The variable is listed in 4.5.1 |
| `{{ENV.VAR_NAME}}` | Section 4.5.2 | The variable is listed in 4.5.2 |
| `{{response.path.to.field}}` or `{{available_slots.N.field}}` | Section 4.5.4 (per-intent) | The dotted path is declared in 4.5.4 for THIS intent, AND the reference appears in an RT=2 field of THIS intent (`announcement`, `function_output`, etc.) |

### 5.2 Directional ordering check (v1)

The "earlier in the flow" requirement from §14.3.5 is enforced as a v1 check, not full reachability analysis.

For a slot reference `{{slot_name}}` in intent X:

1. **Same-intent slots resolve unconditionally.** If the slot is collected by intent X itself, the reference is valid in any field of X (validationPrompt, RT-specific fields, intentInstructions). The slot is collected before any of X's fields execute.

2. **Upstream slots resolve.** If 4.5.3 says the slot is collected by intent Y, AND intent Y is **not downstream** of intent X in the transition graph (section 6.2), the reference resolves. Downstream = reachable from X via outbound transitions.

3. **Downstream slots block.** If Y is downstream of X (X transitions to Y, directly or transitively), the reference is a runtime bug. Block:

   > Reference `{{<slot>}}` in `<intent X>.<field>` references a slot collected by `<intent Y>`. But `<Y>` is downstream of `<X>` in the flow graph — at runtime, the slot won't exist yet when this field fires. Possibilities: (a) the reference is wrong, (b) the flow graph order is wrong (structural — Skill 1 patch). Which?

4. **Cousin intents warn but permit.** If Y is neither upstream nor downstream of X (no transition path either way), warn:

   > Reference `{{<slot>}}` in `<intent X>.<field>` references a slot collected by `<intent Y>`. `<Y>` is neither upstream nor downstream of `<X>` in the flow graph — the runtime path may or may not pass through `<Y>` before `<X>` fires. Verify the call flow is OK with this. Continue, or pause to fix?

   Log the user's choice to 7.3. Continue or halt per their decision.

This v1 check is conservative-without-being-paranoid: catches obvious downstream errors, lets cousin-intent ambiguity through with explicit user confirmation. Full reachability analysis ("every path from start passes through Y before X") is v2.

### 5.3 Check timing

| Timing | Action |
|---|---|
| At write-time during step 2/3/4 | If Skill 2 catches an unresolvable reference while drafting, interrupt and ask the user before continuing. Do not silently emit broken text. |
| End-of-intent gate (check 9 in §6) | Re-verify all references in the intent's fields resolve. Blocking. |

### 5.4 Why blocking at Skill 2 vs advisory at Skill 1

Skill 1's pre-check is advisory because Skill 1 doesn't have all slots elaborated yet — false positives are common. By Skill 2 time, the slot inventory is final and the actual references are being written. An unresolvable reference at this stage is a real bug. Skill 3 also runs the authoritative §15.4 check — Skill 2's blocking check catches issues earlier, where the user is already authoring content.

### 7.3 4.5.3 regeneration mechanic

Section 4.5.3 format from Skill 1's spec-skeleton:

```
- `{{slot_name}}` — collected by `<intent_identifier>`, type `<ParameterTypeId name>`
```

There is no description field. Skill 2's slot description (authored in step 1) lives in section 5, not 4.5.3. The 4.5.3 regeneration is a consistency operation: walk all intents in section 5 (including those still `[structural]`), enumerate slots, write the standard line per slot. In normal cases, the regenerated 4.5.3 is identical to Skill 1's version. If it differs, that's a signal section 4 was edited inconsistently — surface to the user as a soft warning.

### 7.4 6.1 incremental update mechanic

Section 6.1 format from Skill 1's spec-skeleton:

```
- reference: `{{variable_name}}` or `{{path.to.field}}`
- used in: [intent identifier, field name]
- resolves via: [section 4.5.X] or [section 5 slot of intent X]
```

Each Mustache reference Skill 2 writes during steps 2/3/4 gets a 6.1 entry appended. Skill 1's initial 6.1 covers references in section 2 (persona, openingAnnouncement, bot-level intentInstructions) and section 4 (RT=2 body fields). Skill 2's additions cover validationPrompt, per-intent intentInstructions, RT-specific announcement/fail_output/function_output fields.

Skill 3 will regenerate section 6 entirely as a sanity check before §15.4. If Skill 3's regeneration differs from the spec's 6.1, that's a drift signal Skill 3 reports.

## Appendix B — Prompt structure quick reference

Full templates and worked examples in `conversation-routines-style-guide.md`. This appendix is the brief.

**Scope (v1.21.0):** the Markdown structure in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/prompt-structure.md` applies to `intentInstructions` (per-intent and bot-level) and to `validationPrompt`. It replaces the former Conversation Routines style. `validationPrompt` still carries FP-5 capture-mapping content — short `*` bullets in save/capture/set language under a `# 1. Capture mapping` heading (see the minimal example below and style guide §3). The spoken fields (`announcement`, `intentLoadingAnnouncement`, `fail_output`, `function_output`) stay plain prose with no Markdown.

**Required elements (intentInstructions):**

1. **Section headings** anchor the structure. The first is `# 1. <Title>`; every later one is `#### N. <Title>`. Per-intent `intentInstructions` uses `# 1. Post-execution`; `validationPrompt` uses `# 1. Capture mapping`.
2. **Numbered steps** for post-execution actions, each with a bold label stating the step or condition, and its actions as nested `*` bullets.
3. **Branches** are numbered steps whose bold label states the condition — `2. **If the customer refuses:**`.
4. **`CRITICAL:` lines** for non-negotiables, indented under the rule bullet they qualify. Replaces the former `IRON RULE:` token.

**Forbidden:**

- Free prose paragraphs ("After the user gives their address, just verify it makes sense and then move on.")
- Vague directives ("Be helpful.")
- Channel-specific behavior in `validationPrompt` or `intentInstructions` (belongs in voiceInstructions / chatInstructions, section 2)
- Persistent policy ("We're GDPR-compliant. We never share data.") in `intentInstructions` (belongs in persona, section 2.1)

**Minimal valid `validationPrompt` (v1.21.0, FP-5 — capture mapping only; the asking lives in the previous intent's announcement or this intent's instructions):**

```
# 1. Capture mapping

* Save the customer's full address (street, house number, city) in the parameter address.
* If any part is missing, leave the parameter unfilled.
```

**Minimal valid post-execution `intentInstructions` (v1.21.0 — wait rule + routing by tool name + Description):**

```
# 1. Post-execution

1. **After asking:**
   * Stop and wait for the customer's explicit answer. Do not proceed until the customer responds.

2. **If the address was captured:**
   * Then call the tool **fetch_available_slots** — "Fetching available time slots".

3. **If the customer refuses or the address is unusable:**
   * Then call the tool **transfer_to_human** — "Transferring the call to a human representative".

* **Scope:** do not discuss pricing or technical issues.
  CRITICAL: for those, call the tool **transfer_to_human** — "Transferring the call to a human representative".
```

### 9.2 Per invocation completion (user pauses or queue exhausted)

After the final batch in this invocation:

> [N] intents detailed in this invocation. [M] intents still pending: [list, or "none"]. Re-invoke Skill 2 to continue, or invoke Skill 3 if [M] = 0.

### 9.3 Final completion (all intents `[detailed]`)

When the work queue is exhausted and section 7.5 reports zero pending:

- Section 7.3 log entry: `Skill 2 detailing complete. All intents [detailed]. Spec ready for Skill 3.`
- Section 7.5: `0 intents pending. 0 hard intents pending. Ready for Skill 3.`
- Closing message:

> Spec is fully detailed. All intents are `[detailed]`. Open unknowns (section 7.4): [count]. Next step: invoke **Skill 3 (JSON Assembler & Publish)** to emit the wire-format JSON.
>
> [single-conversation: type "run Skill 3" or attach this spec to a fresh conversation]
> [Claude Code: invoke Skill 3 — it reads the same `agent-spec.md` file]
