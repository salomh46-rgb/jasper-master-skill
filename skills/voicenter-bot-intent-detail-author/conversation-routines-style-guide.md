# Prompt Style Guide

*(filename retained as `conversation-routines-style-guide.md`; the Conversation Routines style it was named for was replaced in v1.21.0 by the Markdown structure below.)*

**Purpose:** concrete templates and worked examples for the fields Skill 2 authors — the capture-mapping `validationPrompt`, the spoken `announcement` / `intentLoadingAnnouncement`, and post-execution `intentInstructions`. Supports Skill 2 (Intent Detail Author) — Skill 2 references this file during steps 2–4.

**Scope (v1.21.0):** `intentInstructions` and `validationPrompt` are **Markdown-structured** per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/prompt-structure.md` — that file owns the shape (headings, bullet form, section names); this one owns the patterns that fill it. The former Conversation Routines style (bare ALL-CAPS headers, bare numbered steps, `IRON RULE:`) is superseded. `validationPrompt` still carries the FP-5 **capture-mapping** content — consumed only by the Intent Agent, never spoken; scripts written there never reach the caller. Bot-level `prompts.intentInstructions` (Opening Behavior in section 2.4) takes the same Markdown shape but is Skill 1's domain. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/field-placement-doctrine.md` for the full placement doctrine.

**The spoken fields are exempt.** `announcement`, `intentLoadingAnnouncement`, `fail_output` and `function_output` stay plain prose with no Markdown — TTS reads scaffolding aloud (Compass rule 8, blocking).

**Source:** `prompt-structure.md` defines the shape; field-placement doctrine v1.13.0 defines what goes where. This file expands with concrete patterns.

## 1. Required elements (intentInstructions)

| Element | Form | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Opening section heading | `# 1. Post-execution` | `# 1. Post-execution` |
| Later section headings | `#### N. <Title>` | `#### 2. Escalation` |
| Named rule | `* **<Label>:** <rule>` | `* **Scope:** do not discuss pricing.` |
| Branch | Numbered step, bold condition, nested action bullets | `2. **If the customer refuses:**` |
| Non-negotiable | `CRITICAL: <rule>` (replaces `IRON RULE:`) | `CRITICAL: never reveal the layer transfer.` |
| Naming another intent | `**<tool_name>** — "<Description>"` | `**transfer_to_human** — "Handing the call to a human representative"` |
| FP-4 quote convention for mandated speech | `<instruction text> : "<verbatim line>"` | `Say to the customer : "מצויין, אז קבענו ל {{callback_time}}"` |

## 2. Forbidden patterns

| Pattern | Why bad | Where it belongs instead |
|---|---|---|
| Spoken script / question / greeting inside `validationPrompt` (v1.13.0, FP-5) | The Intent Agent is the only consumer — the caller NEVER hears it | `announcement` (or an FP-4 quoted line in `intentInstructions`) |
| Turn-taking guard inside `validationPrompt` or repeated per intent (v1.13.0, FP-6) | Wrong layer (never seen by the voice model) + duplication bloat | `prompts.persona` — stated once |
| Free prose ("Be helpful and friendly throughout.") | No anchors; LLM behavior drifts | Nowhere — delete or restructure |
| Vague directives ("Make it clear what we offer.") | Unverifiable | Persona, with concrete scope language |
| Channel-specific behavior ("Speak slowly and pause.") | Misplacement per §14.3.9 | `prompts.voiceInstructions` (section 2.2) |
| Persistent policy ("We're GDPR-compliant.") | Misplacement per §14.3.13 | `prompts.persona` (section 2.1) |
| Slot validation logic in `intentInstructions` | Misplacement per §14.3.12 — runs after slots are already collected | `validationPrompt` (as capture-constraint lines) |
| Pre-intent disambiguation in per-intent `intentInstructions` | Misplacement per §14.3.11 — runs after the intent has already fired | `prompts.intentInstructions` (bot-level, section 2.4) |
| Referencing another intent's parameter ("Set status_x to …") (v1.13.0, FP-8) | Un-executable — an intent can only set its own slots | The parameter's owning terminal |
| Routing by tool name / identifier (v1.13.0, FP-9) | The voice model identifies tools by their Description text | Route by section-4 Description text |

---

## 3. `validationPrompt` capture-mapping patterns (v1.13.0)

The `validationPrompt` lives in `IntentConfig.prompts.validationPrompt`. It is read ONLY by the Intent Agent — its sole job is mapping the caller's answer (to the question asked one step earlier, per FP-2 staggering) into this intent's parameters. One section, `# 1. Capture mapping`, then short `*` bullets in save/capture/set language, English operational prose, target-language text only as quoted saved VALUES.

Every pattern below is the **body** of that section — each example is written out under its `# 1. Capture mapping` heading.

### Pattern C1 — Boolean gate (yes/no confirmation)

Use when: the intent captures a confirm/disapprove answer into a BOOLEAN slot. (Golden-reference verbatim style.)

```
# 1. Capture mapping

* If the customer confirms, save "true" in the parameter details_confirmed.
* If the customer disapproves, save "false" in the parameter details_confirmed.
```

### Pattern C2 — Free-text capture (callback time, name, address)

Use when: the intent captures the caller's stated value into a STRING slot. Interpretation machinery (relative dates, "עוד שעה") does NOT go here — it lives in the bot-level opening instructions per FP-12 (Skill 1's domain).

```
# 1. Capture mapping

* Save the callback time (day and time - hour) in the parameter callback_time.
```

```
# 1. Capture mapping

* Save the customer's full address (street, house number, city) in the parameter address.
* If any part is missing, leave the parameter unfilled.
```

### Pattern C3 — Terminal outcome slot (three value modes)

Use when: the intent is an RT=1 terminal carrying a section-4 `**Terminal outcome:**`. Pick the sub-variant matching the declared value mode.

**C3a — fixed** (the spec quotes an exact string):

```
# 1. Capture mapping

* **Fixed value:** set shikuf_status to exactly this value; do not translate, paraphrase, or alter it: "הלקוח לא אישר משהו"
  CRITICAL: never ask the customer to choose or confirm this value — it is fixed for this outcome.
```

**C3b — captured** (save what the customer said):

```
# 1. Capture mapping

* Save the customer's stated reason for declining, in the customer's own words, in the parameter decline_reason.
```

**C3c — dynamic** (composed per call by instruction):

```
# 1. Capture mapping

* Compose a one-sentence Hebrew summary of the call outcome (which stages were confirmed, where it stopped) and save it in the parameter call_summary.
  CRITICAL: do not ask the customer anything to produce it.
```

### Pattern C4 — ENUM multi-choice capture

Use when: slot is `ParameterTypeId 19` (ENUM) with an `OptionList` — the slot selects among MULTIPLE fixed values (FP-13). The presenting of options happens in the previous announcement; here only the mapping.

```
# 1. Capture mapping

* Map the customer's answer to one of the OptionList values: installation / repair / cancellation.
* Save the matched Value in the parameter service_type.
* If the answer clearly matches none of the options, leave the parameter unfilled.
```

### Pattern C5 — Multi-slot capture

Use when: the intent owns ≥2 collectable slots. One capture line per slot — and note the box below.

```
# 1. Capture mapping

* Save the customer's full name in the parameter full_name.
* Save the customer's phone number (digits only, exactly 10 digits; strip dashes and spaces) in the parameter phone_number. If fewer than 10 digits, leave unfilled.
```

> **The ASKING lives elsewhere.** The questions for these slots are asked one per turn where the voice model can see them — in the previous intent's `announcement` or this intent's `intentInstructions` (FP-4 quoted lines), ordered by `CollectionOrder`. Never write "Ask for…" here (sequential-collection iron rule, Skill 2 §4.2).

Format/range constraints for v1-fallback slots (phone/date/email stored as STRING) ride on the slot's capture line, as in C5's phone example — constraint language ("save only if…", "strip silently", "leave unfilled if…"), never dialogue.

---

## 3b. `announcement` patterns (v1.13.0)

`announcement` lives in `IntentResponces.Configuration.announcement` — the deterministic speech channel, spoken when the intent's tool completes. If a sentence is compliance-critical, it belongs here, verbatim.

### Read-back + next question (RT=3 gate — the FP-2 staggered core)

The announcement delivers this stage's scripted content and ends with the question the NEXT intent captures (`**Asks next:**`):

```
התוכנית: {{policies}}, חברת הביטוח: {{insurer}}, פרמיה חודשית לאחר הנחה: {{monthlypremiumafterdiscount}}. לתשומת ליבך, ייתכן שהפרמיה תתעדכן בעקבות בדיקה נוספת של חברת הביטוח. האם הפרטים נכונים?
```

Rules: real `{{CustomData}}`/slot vars from sections 4.5.5/4.5.3 only (FP-11); ends with the question; NO filler ("תודה.") — acknowledgment goes to `intentLoadingAnnouncement`.

### Pre-terminal farewell (v1.14.0, FP-8)

**The RT=1 terminal itself has NO `announcement`.** The outcome-specific farewell, in full and exactly once (FP-6), is an FP-4 quoted line in the **predecessor's** `intentInstructions` — the last spoken line before the forward, with the no-wait / no-reveal instruction (pattern I3 is the canonical shape):

```
# 1. Post-execution

1. **Speak the farewell:**
   * Say to the customer : "מתנצלת, אבל בגלל שלא אישרת את אחד מהפרטים, עליי להעביר את זה לנציג אנושי. נציג יחזור אליך בהקדם. יום טוב."

2. **Then route immediately:**
   * Then call the tool **end_call_transfer_human** — "Ending the call by transferring to a human representative".
   * **Do not wait** for an answer.
     CRITICAL: never tell the customer the call is being transferred to a layer.
```

The terminal keeps only its short loading goodbye ("יום טוב!"). If the predecessor splits to several intents, the farewell gets its own dedicated pre-IVR intent (FP-3 corollary — structural, Skill 1).

### Intentionally empty announcement (FP-3 — exactly two cases, v1.14.0)

**(a) API-list read-out:** the speech is carried by the intent's `intentInstructions` reading instructions — e.g., reading an API-response list, where a fixed transition sentence would get in the way:

```
announcement: ""

intentInstructions:
# 1. Post-execution

1. **Read the options:**
   * Read each option in {{available_slots}} to the customer, one at a time, pausing between items.

2. **Then ask:**
   * Ask the customer : "איזה מהמועדים מתאים לך ?"
   * After asking, stop and wait for the customer's explicit answer.
```

**(b) Pre-terminal farewell-in-instructions:** the intent immediately before the final RT=1 terminal, with **no splits to other intents** — its farewell lives in its own `intentInstructions` per the pattern above.

Log to spec 7.3: `announcement intentionally empty on [intent] — FP-3 case (a|b)`. No other empty-announcement case is allowed.

---

## 3c. `intentLoadingAnnouncement` patterns (v1.13.0, FP-7)

Spoken while the tool executes. **Mandatory on every RT=3 intent** — unset produces the default "." SAY directive (duplicated phrases / dead air in production). Short, natural, matching the persona's register and grammatical gender (female voice ⇒ "רושמת", not "רושם").

| Context | Example |
|---|---|
| Gate acknowledgment (female persona) | "מצויין, אני רושמת" / "אין בעיה, שניה רושמת" / "אחלה, רק שומרת את התשובה" |
| Terminal goodbye (RT=1) | "יום טוב!" / "מעביר לנציג אנושי." — the terminal's ONLY utterance (v1.14.0); NEVER the full farewell, which lives in the predecessor's instructions (FP-8; checks 14/18) |
| API wait (RT=2) | "רק רגע, אני בודקת במערכת" |

Never put full content sentences here, and never duplicate a sentence that exists in `announcement`.

**`max_turns_sentence` (v1.14.0):** authored once per bot in the same register/gender discipline — masculine `"מתנצל אבל נראה שיש לי בעיה מסויימת, אנא נסה שנית מאוחר יותר"`, feminine `"מתנצלת אבל נראה שיש לי בעיה מסויימת, אנא נסה שנית מאוחר יותר"`.

---

## 4. Post-execution `intentInstructions` patterns

`intentInstructions` lives in `IntentResponces.Configuration.intentInstructions`. Post-execution: delivered to the voice model after the tool completes — routing, the wait rule, and (when needed) FP-4 quoted spoken lines.

The field carries one section, `# 1. Post-execution`. Add further `#### N. <Title>` sections only when the intent genuinely has more than one post-execution concern.

**FP-4 quote convention callout:** every spoken line mandated in these instructions uses `<instruction text> : "<verbatim line>"` — e.g., `Say to the customer : "מצויין, אז קבענו ל {{callback_time}}, נחזור אלייך, שיהיה המשך יום טוב"`. The quoting doubles as Compass rule 11 RTL isolation.

**Naming another intent (v1.21.0):** write `**<tool_name>** — "<Description>"`, giving both the tool name and its section-4 Description text verbatim. This replaces the former Description-only form (FP-9).

### Pattern I1 — Minimal single-path

Use when: the intent has one outcome and one next step.

```
# 1. Post-execution

1. **After asking:**
   * Stop and wait for the customer's explicit answer. Do not save a value or proceed until the customer responds.

2. **If the customer answered:**
   * Then call the tool **fetch_available_slots** — "Fetching available time slots".

* **Scope:** do not discuss pricing or technical issues.
  CRITICAL: for those, call the tool **transfer_to_human** — "Transferring the call to a human representative".
```

### Pattern I2 — Branching on the captured answer (the FP-2 gate pattern; golden-reference shape)

Use when: the announcement asked a yes/no question and the routing branches on the answer.

```
# 1. Post-execution

1. **After reading the details and asking the question:**
   * Stop and wait for the customer's explicit answer. Do not save a value or proceed to the next intent until the customer responds.

2. **If the customer approves:**
   * Then call the tool **confirm_health_declaration** — "confirming health declaration".

3. **If the customer disapproves:**
   * Then call the tool **end_call_hangup** — "Ending the call by forwarding the call to a hangup layer".
```

### Pattern I3 — Mandated spoken line + immediate route (FP-4)

Use when: a short closing/confirmation line must be spoken and then the call routes on — typical when the announcement is empty or the line depends on a just-captured slot.

```
# 1. Post-execution

1. **Speak the closing line, then route without waiting:**
   * Say to the customer : "מצויין, אז קבענו ל {{callback_time}}, נחזור אלייך, שיהיה המשך יום טוב"
   * Then call the tool **end_call_hangup** — "Ending the call by forwarding the call to a hangup layer".
     CRITICAL: do not wait for an answer before routing.
```

### Pattern I4 — RT=2 with conditional API silence escalation

Use when: an RT=2 intent has a non-trivial API silence fallback path that should be reflected in post-execution instructions (e.g., the API silence escalates to a different intent than the success path).

```
# 1. Post-execution

1. **If the API responded successfully within the silence window:**
   * Read the response details from {{response.summary}}.
   * Then call the tool **confirm_appointment_details** — "Confirming the appointment details".

2. **If the API silence_ending_sentence fired (the API took too long):**
   * The silence handler already announced the delay.
   * Then call the tool **transfer_to_human** — "Transferring the call to a human representative".

* **Retries:** the silence behaviour owns retries; this intent is post-call.
  CRITICAL: do not retry the API in this intent.
```

---

## 5. Worked example — complete staggered intent (v1.13.0, golden-reference shape)

Bringing it together: an RT=3 gate (`verify_plan_and_premium`) in a staggered verification flow. Section 4 declares: **Description:** `Verification of plan and premia`; **Captures answer to:** the identity read-back question asked by the opening instructions ("האם הפרטים נכונים?"); **Asks next:** the plan/premium confirmation question.

### Slot definition (from step 1)

```
Slot: details_confirmed
- Description: אישור הלקוח שפרטי הזיהוי שלו ושל המבוטחים הנוספים נכונים. כן/לא.
- Type: BOOLEAN (ParameterTypeId 16)
- Required: true
- Collection order: 1
```

Note the deliberate offset: the slot captures the IDENTITY question (asked one step earlier, by the opening), while this intent's announcement asks the PLAN question — that's FP-2 staggering, not a naming mistake.

### `validationPrompt` (from step 2 — capture mapping only, pattern C1)

```
# 1. Capture mapping

* If the customer confirms, save "true" in the parameter details_confirmed.
* If the customer disapproves, save "false" in the parameter details_confirmed.
```

### `announcement` (from step 3 — read-back + the `**Asks next:**` question, §3b)

```
התוכנית: {{policies}}, חברת הביטוח: {{insurer}}, פרמיה חודשית לאחר הנחה: {{monthlypremiumafterdiscount}}. לתשומת ליבך, ייתכן שהפרמיה תתעדכן בעקבות בדיקה נוספת של חברת הביטוח. האם הפרטים נכונים?
```

### `intentLoadingAnnouncement` (from step 3 — mandatory on RT=3, §3c)

```
מצויין, אני רושמת
```

### Post-execution `intentInstructions` (from step 4 — pattern I2)

```
# 1. Post-execution

1. **After reading the plan and premium details and asking the question:**
   * Stop and wait for the customer's explicit answer. Do not save a value or proceed to the next intent until the customer responds.

2. **If the customer approves:**
   * Then call the tool **confirm_health_declaration** — "confirming health declaration".

3. **If the customer disapproves:**
   * Then call the tool **end_call_hangup** — "Ending the call by forwarding the call to a hangup layer".
```

---

## 6. Common authoring pitfalls and fixes

### Pitfall 1 — "Just be helpful" prose creeps in

Bad — in `intentInstructions`:

```
# 1. Post-execution

1. **Be helpful and patient if the customer needs to think.**
2. **Move on when ready.**
```

Why bad: step 1 is unverifiable prose. The LLM doesn't know what "helpful and patient" means concretely.

Fix: replace with a concrete behavior or remove.

```
# 1. Post-execution

1. **After asking:**
   * Stop and wait for the customer's explicit answer.
   * If the customer pauses or asks to think, wait without repeating the question.

2. **If the customer answered:**
   * Then call the tool **fetch_available_slots** — "Fetching available time slots".
```

### Pitfall 2 — Validation logic ends up post-execution

Bad — in `intentInstructions`:

```
# 1. Post-execution

1. **After collecting the phone, ensure it's exactly 10 digits.**
2. **Strip dashes silently.**
3. **Confirm.**
```

Why bad: by the time `intentInstructions` runs, the phone is already collected. The validation rules never fire.

Fix: the constraints become capture-constraint lines in `validationPrompt` (pattern C5); the instructions keep only genuinely-post-execution behavior.

`validationPrompt`:
```
# 1. Capture mapping

* Save the customer's phone number (digits only, exactly 10 digits; strip dashes and spaces silently) in the parameter phone_number.
* If fewer than 10 digits or it contains letters, leave the parameter unfilled.
```

`intentInstructions`:
```
# 1. Post-execution

1. **After asking:**
   * Stop and wait for the customer's explicit answer.

2. **If the phone number was captured:**
   * Then call the tool for the next step, naming it as **<tool_name>** — "<its Description text>".
```

### Pitfall 3 — Bot-level routing logic in per-intent fields

Bad — in `validate_customer_address.intentInstructions`:

```
# 1. Post-execution

1. **When the caller first reaches us, figure out if they want to schedule or reschedule.**
2. **If schedule:**
   * Validate the address.
3. **If reschedule:**
   * Then call the tool **reschedule_existing** — "Rescheduling an existing appointment".
```

Why bad: by the time `validate_customer_address` is firing, disambiguation has already happened — that's why this intent fired. This text is dead code.

Fix: this content belongs in `prompts.intentInstructions` (bot-level, section 2.4). Skill 2 raises to user; Skill 1 patch mode adds it to section 2.4.

`validate_customer_address.intentInstructions` (corrected):
```
# 1. Post-execution

1. **Confirm the address back.**
2. **Then route:**
   * Then call the tool **get_available_slots** — "Fetching available appointment times".
```

### Pitfall 4 — Persistent policy embedded in one intent

Bad — in `validate_customer_address.intentInstructions`:

```
# 1. Post-execution

1. **Confirm the address.**
2. **Note:** we never share customer data with third parties.
3. **Note:** we are GDPR-compliant; recordings are kept 30 days max.
4. **Then route:**
   * Then call the tool **get_available_slots** — "Fetching available appointment times".
```

Why bad: the privacy policy applies to *every* intent. Putting it here means the LLM only "knows" the policy when this intent is active. In every other intent, the policy isn't in context.

Fix: move policy to `prompts.persona` (section 2.1). Skill 2 raises to user; Skill 1 patch mode handles the persona update.

### Pitfall 5 — Spoken script inside `validationPrompt` (v1.13.0, FP-5 — the #1 production failure)

Bad — in `validationPrompt` (real pipeline output, pre-v1.13):

```
GATE — PLAN & PREMIUM
1. Read clearly: the plan {{policies}}; the insurer {{insurer}}; the premium {{premium_after_discount}}.
2. Ask, in Hebrew:
   "האם זו התוכנית שביקשת לרכוש, והאם העלות מקובלת עליך?"
TURN-TAKING GUARD: wait for the customer's answer before proceeding...
```

Why bad: the Intent Agent is the ONLY consumer of `validationPrompt` — the voice model never sees it. The caller never hears the read-back or the question; the gate silently doesn't happen. The turn-taking guard is equally invisible.

Fix: script + question → `announcement` (§3b); guard → persona, once (FP-6); `validationPrompt` keeps only the capture mapping (C1). Caught by Skill 2 check 3 and CHK-16.

### Pitfall 6 — Setting another intent's parameter (v1.13.0, FP-8)

Bad — in a gate's `intentInstructions`:

```
* If the customer disapproves, set status_shikuf to: "הלקוח לא אישר משהו" and proceed to finalize_verification.
```

Why bad: `status_shikuf` belongs to a different intent. An intent can only set its own `IntentParameters` — this line is un-executable; at best ignored, at worst vocalized or hallucinated around.

Fix: the status lives on the terminal that represents this outcome, with its value written by that terminal's own `validationPrompt` (pattern C3). The gate just routes: `* If the customer disapproves, call the tool **end_call_hangup** — "Ending the call by forwarding the call to a hangup layer".` Caught by Skill 2 check 13 and CHK-18.

### Pitfall 7 — Duplicated farewell obligations (v1.13.0, FP-6)

Bad — call end spread across two intents and three fields:

```
finalize_verification.validationPrompt: ...speak the outcome-specific closing line...
finalize_verification.announcement: "תודה."
end_call.intentLoadingAnnouncement: "יום טוב ולהתראות."
```

Why bad: three separate speech obligations at call end — the diagnosed mechanism behind farewell-said-twice bugs. Plus an extra tool round-trip through the chained terminal.

Fix (v1.14.0): ONE terminal per outcome; the full closing line as an FP-4 quoted line in the **predecessor's** `intentInstructions` (last spoken line, then forward immediately — no wait, no reveal); the terminal keeps only the short loading goodbye. No terminal→terminal chains. Caught by Skill 2 checks 14/18 and CHK-19/CHK-20.

### Pitfall 8 — "תודה." filler announcement (v1.13.0, FP-3)

Bad:

```
announcement: "תודה."
```

Why bad: the announcement is the deterministic speech channel — wasting it on a contentless acknowledgment creates a stilted rhythm and one more speech obligation per turn, while the real script hides in the wrong field.

Fix: acknowledgment belongs in `intentLoadingAnnouncement` ("מצויין, אני רושמת") where it naturally covers tool latency; `announcement` carries the read-back + the `**Asks next:**` question, or is intentionally empty per FP-3. Caught by the Skill 2 filler advisory and staggered-consistency check 16.

## 7. Checklist: are my fields placed and styled correctly? (v1.13.0)

Run through this before flipping an intent to `[detailed]`.

**validationPrompt (capture mapping, FP-5):**
- [ ] Opens with `# 1. Capture mapping`, then short `*` bullets in save/capture/set language — one line per collectable slot / outcome
- [ ] NO speech: no ask/say/tell/greet/read-back imperatives, no question to the caller, no turn-taking guards, no routing
- [ ] Quoted strings appear only as VALUES being saved
- [ ] `**Terminal outcome:**` intents: the declared value mode is implemented (fixed ⇒ exact pinned string + never-ask line)

**announcement / intentLoadingAnnouncement (FP-2/FP-3/FP-7/FP-8):**
- [ ] `announcement` carries the read-back + the `**Asks next:**` question (or is intentionally empty per one of the two FP-3 cases — API-list read-out / pre-terminal farewell-in-instructions — logged to 7.3)
- [ ] No filler ("תודה.") in `announcement`
- [ ] RT=1: NO `announcement` at all (v1.14.0); loading announcement is a short "יום טוב"-style line; the farewell exists exactly once, on the predecessor's instructions
- [ ] Any intent transitioning into an RT=1: its instructions end with the FP-4 quoted farewell + immediate-forward / no-wait / no-reveal instruction
- [ ] RT=3: `intentLoadingAnnouncement` non-empty, persona/gender-matched
- [ ] `max_turns_sentence` written once per bot, persona/gender-matched (v1.14.0)
- [ ] No sentence appears in two fields (FP-6 say-once)

**intentInstructions (Markdown structure + FP-4/FP-9):**
- [ ] Opens with `# 1. Post-execution`; any further section is `#### N. <Title>`
- [ ] Contains the explicit wait rule ("stop and wait for the customer's explicit answer")
- [ ] All branching uses numbered steps whose bold label states the condition, with actions as nested bullets
- [ ] Names every other intent as `**<tool_name>** — "<Description>"`, Description text verbatim from section 4
- [ ] Every mandated spoken line uses the FP-4 form `<instruction> : "<line>"`
- [ ] References only THIS intent's parameters (FP-8)
- [ ] If the intent asks ≥2 questions: one question per turn, in `CollectionOrder`
- [ ] Every non-negotiable is written `CRITICAL:`, never `IRON RULE:`
- [ ] No paragraphs of free prose
- [ ] No channel-specific behavior (pacing, formatting, emoji policy) — these belong in section 2.2 / 2.3
- [ ] No persistent policy (privacy, GDPR, retention) — these belong in section 2.1
- [ ] No bot-level disambiguation (greeting, routing) — this belongs in section 2.4
- [ ] No slot validation logic — constraints ride the capture lines in `validationPrompt`

**Cross-field:**
- [ ] All Mustache references resolve (per Skill 2 §5 mechanics; CustomData keys from 4.5.5 only)
- [ ] Text language matches the bot's primary language for spoken content; capture mapping in English operational prose

Pass on every line → safe to mark `[detailed]`.

## TTS-safety addendum (Compass rule 8 + rule 11)

These rules apply to the **spoken** fields Skill 2 authors when the bot has an active voice channel: `announcement`, `intentLoadingAnnouncement`, `fail_output`, `function_output`, and the FP-4 quoted lines of post-execution `intentInstructions`. (`validationPrompt` is exempt from rule 8 since v1.13.0 — it is never vocalized, and its capture-mapping form legitimately uses `*` bullets. Rule 11 RTL isolation still applies to every field.)

### No markdown formatting in voice fields

Markdown bullets (`-`, `*`, `+`), headers (`#`), and links (`[text](url)`) are read aloud literally by TTS. Forbidden in the spoken fields listed above.

**Don't:**

```
- שלום, איך אני יכולה לעזור?
- אנא ספק את פרטיך
```

**Do:**

```
שלום, איך אני יכולה לעזור?
אנא ספק את פרטיך.
```

### No URLs spoken aloud

Voice agents should not vocalize URLs. Replace with descriptions ("our website", "the support page") or remove from the prompt entirely.

### Long digit runs need spell-out instructions

Sequences of 6+ digits read awkwardly without an explicit "digit by digit" instruction nearby. Use `חזרי ספרה ספרה` (Hebrew), `Read digit by digit` (English), or the equivalent in the bot's primary language.

### RTL isolation — Hebrew/Arabic/CJK on its own line or inside quotes

Per Compass §4 "Sanity rule": Unicode bidirectional marks tokenize to garbage when RTL content is mixed inline with LTR. Terminal display will look correct; the tokens will not be.

**Don't:**

```
CRITICAL: say שלום to the caller when they arrive.
```

**Do (FP-4 quote convention — instruction, colon, quoted verbatim line):**

```
CRITICAL: greet the caller when they arrive. Say to the customer : "שלום".
```

Or:

```
CRITICAL: greet the caller when they arrive. Say:
שלום
```

The FP-4 form satisfies rule 11 by construction — the RTL content is always inside quotes.
